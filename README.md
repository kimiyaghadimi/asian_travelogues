# A description of the core research questions motivating the project: 
- Asia was still discovering itself at the beginning of the 20th century. Much of this discovery happened through interactions with other Asian and European travellers, texts, and their own ideas. 
- How did travel writing contribute to the formation of national identity?
- How did different Asian travellers share ideas about nationalism and nation during the early 20th century ?
- Specifically, this project explores the ways in which Iranian travellers interacted with European (and particularly French) ideas and nationalisms. We further speculate that South Asian travellers may have interacted with these Iranian travellers. And further, may have travelled to, and shared their ideas with Chinese and Japanese nationalists in the early 20th century. 
- By marking up texts based on these travelogues and traveling ideas, our aim is to model the ways in which these intersections occurred, and if possible, to visualize the ways in which political ideas, ideologies, and actors interacted with each other in the early 20th-century. 
- As the project progresses, we may have to differentiate between concepts such as exile and travel.
